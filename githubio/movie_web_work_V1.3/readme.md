# My Favorite TV_Series Trailers

This is Web project, including three programs(media.py, fresh_tomatoes.py, intertainment_center.py). We can use this programs to create a web page about my favorite TV_shows trailers.

## Tools
- Sublime Text *(I also use Atom sometimes.)*
- iTerm 2 *(instead Terminal)*
- Day one *(useing these APP to make Class notes)*
- Evernote *(Collecting learing materials)*
- Google chrome *(better than Safari, I can use this to manage my bookmarks password both Mac and PC. Of course, the developer tools is very useful.)*

## Quick Start
you can use command line to run this program.
```
python3 entertainment_center.py
```
**hint: Make sure these three files(media.py, fresh_tomatoes.py, intertainment_center.py) in the same directory.**

## Bug fixed

### 1. PEP8 checking issues.

Frist of all, I didn't know this website until you told me.
As the teacher's instruction, I've checked these three programs with [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/).
And I've also downloaded PEP8-aotoformat for sublime text. This is a very useful tools, just use the hotkey "cmd+shitt+r", and neatly formatted. I mean, really convenient.

###  2. Missing Readme file

As you see, this is it. This is first time I write the readme file.
