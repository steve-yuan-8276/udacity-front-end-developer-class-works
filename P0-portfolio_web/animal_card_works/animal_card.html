				<p><strong>The giant panda</strong> , also known as panda bear, is a bear native to south China.It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo.Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.</p>
				<p><strong>Interesting Story</strong> The primary method of breeding giant pandas in captivity was by artificial insemination, as they seemed to lose their interest in mating once they were captured. This led some scientists to try extreme methods, such as showing them videos of giant pandas mating.</p>
